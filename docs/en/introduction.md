JuiceFS is a high-performance [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) file system released under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0. It is specially optimized for the cloud-native environment. Using the JuiceFS  to store data, the data itself will be persisted in object storage (e.g. Amazon S3), and the metadata corresponding to the data can be persisted in various database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and SQLite according to the needs of the scene. 

JuiceFS can simply and conveniently connect massive cloud storage directly to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms that have been put into production environment, without modifying the code, you can use massive cloud storage as efficiently as using local storage.

## Highlighted Features

1. **Fully POSIX-compatible**: Use like a local file system, seamlessly docking with existing applications, no business intrusion.
2. **Fully Hadoop-compatible**: JuiceFS [Hadoop Java SDK](hadoop_java_sdk.md) is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x. As well as variety of components in Hadoop ecosystem.
3. **S3-compatible**:  JuiceFS [S3 Gateway](s3_gateway.md) provides S3-compatible interface.
4. **Cloud Native**: JuiceFS provides [Kubernetes CSI driver](how_to_use_on_kubernetes.md) to help people who want to use JuiceFS in Kubernetes.
5. **Sharing**: JuiceFS is a shared file storage that can be read and written by thousands clients.
6. **Strong Consistency**: The confirmed modification will be immediately visible on all servers mounted with the same file system .
7. **Outstanding Performance**: The latency can be as low as a few milliseconds and the throughput can be expanded to nearly unlimited. [Test results](benchmark.md)
8. **Data Encryption**: Supports data encryption in transit and at rest, read [the guide](encrypt.md) for more information.
9. **Global File Locks**: JuiceFS supports both BSD locks (flock) and POSIX record locks (fcntl).
10. **Data Compression**: JuiceFS supports use [LZ4](https://lz4.github.io/lz4) or [Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd) to compress all your data.

## Performance Comparison

### Throughput

Performed a sequential read/write benchmark on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio), here is the result:

[![Sequential Read Write Benchmark](../images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)](../images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)

It shows JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two, read [more details](fio.md).

### Metadata IOPS

Performed a simple mdtest benchmark on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [mdtest](https://github.com/hpc/ior), here is the result:

[![Metadata Benchmark](../images/metadata-benchmark.svg)](../images/metadata-benchmark.svg)

It shows JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two, read [more details](../en/mdtest.md).
