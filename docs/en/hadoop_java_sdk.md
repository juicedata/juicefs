JuiceFS provides [Hadoop-compatible FileSystem](https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/filesystem/introduction.html) by Hadoop Java SDK to support variety of components in Hadoop ecosystem.

> **NOTICE**:
>
> JuiceFS use local mapping of user and UID. So, you should [sync all the needed users and their UIDs](sync_accounts_between_multiple_hosts.md) across the whole Hadoop cluster to avoid permission error. You can also specify a global user list and user group file, please refer to the [relevant configurations](#other-configurations).

## Hadoop Compatibility

JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK is compatible with Hadoop 2.x and Hadoop 3.x. As well as variety of components in Hadoop ecosystem.

In order to make JuiceFS works with other components, it usually takes 2 steps:

1. Put JAR file into the classpath of each Hadoop ecosystem component.
2. Put JuiceFS configurations into the configuration file of each Hadoop ecosystem component (usually `core-site.xml`).

## Compiling

You need first installing Go 1.13+, JDK 8+ and Maven, then run following commands:

```shell
$ cd sdk/java
$ make
```

> **Tip**: For users in China, it's recommended to set a local Maven mirror to speed-up compilation, e.g. [Aliyun Maven Mirror](https://maven.aliyun.com).

## Deploy JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK

After compiling you could find the JAR file in `sdk/java/target` directory, e.g. `juicefs-hadoop-0.10.0.jar`. Beware that file with `original-` prefix, it doesn't contain third-party dependencies. It's recommended to use the JAR file with third-party dependencies.

> **Note**: The SDK could only be deployed to same operating system as it be compiled. For example, if you compile SDK in Linux then you must deploy it to Linux.

Then put the JAR file and `$JAVA_HOME/lib/tools.jar` to the classpath of each Hadoop ecosystem component. It's recommended create a symbolic link to the JAR file. The following tables describe where the SDK be placed.

When you use multiple JuiceFS file systems, all these configurations could be set to specific file system alone. You need put file system name in the middle of configuration, for example (replace `{JFS_NAME}` with appropriate value):

```xml
<property>
  <name>juicefs.{JFS_NAME}.meta</name>
  <value>redis://host:port/1</value>
</property>
```

### Configurations Example

**Note: Replace `{HOST}`, `{PORT}` and `{DB}` in `juicefs.meta` with appropriate values.**

```xml
<property>
  <name>fs.jfs.impl</name>
  <value>io.juicefs.JuiceFileSystem</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>fs.AbstractFileSystem.jfs.impl</name>
  <value>io.juicefs.JuiceFS</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>juicefs.meta</name>
  <value>redis://{HOST}:{PORT}/{DB}</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>juicefs.cache-dir</name>
  <value>/data*/jfs</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>juicefs.cache-size</name>
  <value>1024</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>juicefs.access-log</name>
  <value>/tmp/juicefs.access.log</value>
</property>
```

### Configuration in Hadoop

Add configurations to `core-site.xml`.

#### CDH6

Besides `core-site`, you also need to configure `mapreduce.application.classpath` of the YARN component, add:

```shell
$HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/lib/juicefs-hadoop.jar
```

#### HDP

Besides `core-site`, you also need to configure `mapreduce.application.classpath` of the MapReduce2 component, add (variables do not need to be replaced):

```shell
/usr/hdp/${hdp.version}/hadoop/lib/juicefs-hadoop.jar
```

### Configuration in Flink

Add configurations to `conf/flink-conf.yaml`. You could only setup Flink client without modify configurations in Hadoop.

## Restart Services

When the following components need to access JuiceFS, they should be restarted.

> **Note**: Before restart, you need to confirm JuiceFS related configuration has been written to the configuration file of each component, usually you can find them in `core-site.xml` on the machine where the service of the component was deployed.

| Components | Services                   |
| ---------- | --------                   |
| Hive       | HiveServer<br />Metastore  |
| Spark      | ThriftServer               |
| Presto     | Coordinator<br />Worker    |
| Impala     | Catalog Server<br />Daemon |
| HBase      | Master<br />RegionServer   |

HDFS, Hue, ZooKeeper and other services don't need to be restarted.

When `Class io.juicefs.JuiceFileSystem not found` or `No FilesSystem for scheme: jfs` exceptions was occurred after restart, reference [FAQ](#faq).

## Verification

### Hadoop

```bash
$ hadoop fs -ls jfs://{JFS_NAME}/
```

> **Note**: The `JFS_NAME` is the volume name when you format JuiceFS file system.

### Hive

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS person
(
  name STRING,
  age INT
) LOCATION 'jfs://{JFS_NAME}/tmp/person';
```

## Metrics

JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK supports reporting metrics to [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway), then you can use [Grafana](https://grafana.com) and [dashboard template](k8s_grafana_template.json) to visualize these metrics.

Enable metrics reporting through following configurations:

```xml
<property>
  <name>juicefs.push-gateway</name>
  <value>host:port</value>
</property>
```

> **Note**: Each process using JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK will have a unique metric, and Pushgateway will always remember all the collected metrics, resulting in the continuous accumulation of metrics and taking up too much memory, which will also slow down Prometheus crawling metrics. It is recommended to clean up metrics which `job` is `juicefs` on Pushgateway regularly. It is recommended to use the following command to clean up once every hour. The running Hadoop Java SDK will continue to update after the metrics are cleared, which basically does not affect the use.
>
> ```bash
> $ curl -X DELETE http://host:9091/metrics/job/juicefs
> ```

For a description of all monitoring metrics, please refer to [JuiceFS Metrics](p8s_metrics.md).

## Benchmark

JuiceFS provides some benchmark tools for you when JuiceFS has been deployed

### Local environment
#### Meta

- create

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.NNBenchWithoutMR -operation create -numberOfFiles 10000 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/nnbench_local
  ```

  It creates 10000 empty files without write data

- open

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.NNBenchWithoutMR -operation open -numberOfFiles 10000 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/nnbench_local
  ```

  It opens 10000 files without read data

- rename

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.NNBenchWithoutMR -operation rename -numberOfFiles 10000 -bytesPerBlock 134217728 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/nnbench_local
  ```

- delete

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.NNBenchWithoutMR -operation delete -numberOfFiles 10000 -bytesPerBlock 134217728 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/nnbench_local
  ```

- for reference

| Operation | TPS  | Delay (ms) |
| --------- | ---  | ---------- |
| create    | 546  | 1.83       |
| open      | 1135 | 0.88       |
| rename    | 364  | 2.75       |
| delete    | 289  | 3.46       |

#### I/O Performance

- sequential write

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.TestFSIO -write -fileSize 20000 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/fsio
  ```

- sequential read

  ```shell
  hadoop jar juicefs-hadoop.jar io.juicefs.bench.TestFSIO -read -fileSize 20000 -baseDir jfs://{JFS_NAME}/benchmarks/fsio
  ```

  When run the cmd for the second time, the result may be much better than the first run. It's because the data was cached in memory, just clean the local disk cache.

### Distribute Benchmark

Distribute benchmark use MapReduce program to test meta and IO throughput performance

Enough resources should be provided to make sure all Map task can be started at the same time

We use 3 4c32g ECS (5Gbit/s) and Aliyun Redis 5.0 4G redis for the benchmark

## FAQ

### `Class io.juicefs.JuiceFileSystem not found` exception

It means JAR file was not loaded, you can verify it by `lsof -p {pid} | grep juicefs`.

You should check whether the JAR file was located properly, or other users have the read permission.

Some Hadoop distribution also need to modify `mapred-site.xml` and put the JAR file location path to the end of the parameter `mapreduce.application.classpath`.

### `No FilesSystem for scheme: jfs` exception

It means JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK was not configured properly, you need to check whether there is JuiceFS related configuration in the `core-site.xml` of the component configuration.
