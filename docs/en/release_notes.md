## Upgrade to JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3

JuiceFS client has only one binary file, so you only need to replace the old version with the new one when upgrading JuiceFS. 

### SQL: Update table schema to support encoding other than UTF-8

JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 has changed the table schema to support encoding other than UTF-8. For existing file systems, you need to upgrade the table schema manually to support that. It's recommended to upgrade all clients first and then the table schema.

:::note
Table schema upgrades are optional, and they are required only if you need to use non-UTF-8 characters. In addition, database performance may degrade when upgrading SQL table schemas, affecting running services.

#### MySQL/MariaDB

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    modify name varbinary(255) not null;
alter table jfs_symlink
    modify target varbinary(4096) not null;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    alter column name type bytea using name::bytea;
alter table jfs_symlink
    alter column target type bytea using target::bytea;
```

#### SQLite

SQLite does not support modifying columns, but you can migrate columns by `dump` and `load` commands, refer to [JuiceFS Metadata Backup and Recovery](administration/metadata_dump_load.md) for details.

### New session management format

JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 uses a new session management format. The previous versions of clients cannot see the sessions generated by v1.0.0 Beta3 clients via `juicefs status` or `juicefs destroy`, whereas the new versions are able to see all the sessions.
