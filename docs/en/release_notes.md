## Upgrade to JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3

JuiceFS client has only one binary file, so when upgrading, you only need to replace the old version with the new one. At the same time, the following points should be noted.

Please note that JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 changed the table schema of the SQL class metadata engine. For file systems that have been created or are running, make table schema changes after upgrading all clients.

### Modify SQL table schema

:::note
Table schema upgrades are not mandatory and are only required if you need to use non-UTF-8 characters.
:::

#### MySQL/MariaDB

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    modify name varbinary(255) not null;
alter table jfs_symlink
    modify target varbinary(4096) not null;
```

#### PostgreSQL

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    alter column name type bytea using name::bytea;
alter table jfs_symlink
    alter column target type bytea using target::bytea;
```

#### SQLite

Since SQLite does not support modifying columns, you can migrate them by `dump` and `load` commands, refer to: [JuiceFS Metadata Backup and Recovery](administration/metadata_dump_load.md) for details.

### New session management format

JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 uses a new session management format, previous versions of clients will not be able to see the sessions generated by v1.0.0 Beta3 clients via `juicefs status` or `juicefs destroy`, new versions of clients can see all sessions.
