## Version number {#version-number}

JuiceFS Community Edition uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org) to label its releases. Each version number consists of three numbers in the format `x.y.z`, representing the major version number (x), the minor version number (y), and the patch number (z).

1. **Major version number (x)**: When the major version number is greater than or equal to `1`, it indicates that the version is suitable for production environments. When the major version number changes, it indicates that this version may have added major features, architectural changes, or data format changes that are not backward compatible. For example, `v0.8.3` → `v1.0.0` means production-ready, `v1.0.0` → `v2.0.0` represents an architectural or functional change.
2. **Minor version number (y)**: The minor version number indicates that the version adds some new features, performance optimizations, bug fixes, etc. that can be backward compatible. For example, `v1.0.0` → `v1.1.0`.
3. **Patch version number (z)**: The patch version number indicates a minor update or bug fix for the software, which is only some minor changes or fixes to existing features and will not affect the compatibility of the softwares. For example, `v1.0.3` → `v1.0.4`.

## Changes {#changes}

### JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3

JuiceFS client has only one binary file, so you only need to replace the old version with the new one when upgrading JuiceFS.

#### SQL: Update table schema to support encoding other than UTF-8

JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 has changed the table schema to support encoding other than UTF-8. For existing file systems, you need to upgrade the table schema manually to support that. It's recommended to upgrade all clients first and then the table schema.

:::note
Table schema upgrades are optional, and they are required only if you need to use non-UTF-8 characters. In addition, database performance may degrade when upgrading SQL table schemas, affecting running services.

##### MySQL/MariaDB

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    modify name varbinary(255) not null;
alter table jfs_symlink
    modify target varbinary(4096) not null;
```

##### PostgreSQL

```sql
alter table jfs_edge
    alter column name type bytea using name::bytea;
alter table jfs_symlink
    alter column target type bytea using target::bytea;
```

##### SQLite

SQLite does not support modifying columns, but you can migrate columns by `dump` and `load` commands, refer to [JuiceFS Metadata Backup and Recovery](administration/metadata_dump_load.md) for details.

#### New session management format

JuiceFS v1.0.0 Beta3 uses a new session management format. The previous versions of clients cannot see the sessions generated by v1.0.0 Beta3 clients via `juicefs status` or `juicefs destroy`, whereas the new versions are able to see all the sessions.
