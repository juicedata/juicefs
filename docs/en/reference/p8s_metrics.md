# JuiceFS Metrics

JuiceFS provides a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) API for each file system. The default API address is `http://localhost:9567/metrics`, you could custom the address through `--metrics` option when execute [`juicefs mount`](../reference/command_reference.md#juicefs-mount) or [`juicefs gateway`](../reference/command_reference.md#juicefs-gateway) command.

JuiceFS also provides a [dashboard template](grafana_template.json) for [Grafana](https://grafana.com), which can be
imported to show the collected metrics in Prometheus.

## Use Consul as registration center

JuiceFS support use Consul as registration center for metrics API. You could custom the address through `--consul` option when execute [`juicefs mount`](../reference/command_reference.md#juicefs-mount) or [`juicefs gateway`](../reference/command_reference.md#juicefs-gateway) command.

When the Consul address is configured, the `--metrics` option does not need to be configured. JuiceFS will automatically configure metrics URL according to its own network and port conditions. If `--metrics` is set at the same time, it will first try to listen on the configured metrics URL.

For each instance registered to Consul, its `serviceName` is `juicefs`, and the format of `serviceId` is `<IP>:<mount-point>`, for example: `127.0.0.1:/tmp/jfs`.

The meta of each instance contains two aspects: `hostname` and `mountpoint`. When `mountpoint` is `s3gateway`, which means that the instance is an S3 gateway.

Below are descriptions of each metrics.

## Global labels

| Name       | Description      |
| ----       | -----------      |
| `vol_name` | Volume name      |
| `mp`       | Mount point path |

:::info
When Prometheus scrapes a target, it attaches `instance` label automatically to the scraped time series which serve to identify the scraped target, its format is `<host>:<port>`. Refer to [official document](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances) for more information.
:::

:::info
If the monitoring metrics are reported through [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway) (for example, [JuiceFS Hadoop Java SDK](../deployment/hadoop_java_sdk.md#monitoring-metrics-collection)), the value of the `mp` label is `sdk-<PID>`, and the value of the `instance` label is the host name.
