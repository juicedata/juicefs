#### Metadata related options {#mount-metadata-options}

|Items|Description|
|-|-|
|`--subdir=value`|mount a sub-directory as root (default: "")|
|`--backup-meta=3600`|interval (in seconds) to automatically backup metadata in the object storage (0 means disable backup) (default: "3600")|
|`--backup-skip-trash` <VersionAdd>1.2</VersionAdd>|skip files and directories in trash when backup metadata.|
|`--heartbeat=12`|interval (in seconds) to send heartbeat; it's recommended that all clients use the same heartbeat value (default: "12")|
|`--read-only`|Read-only mode, i.e. allow only lookup/read operations. Note that this option implies `--no-bgjob`, so read-only clients do not execute background jobs.|
|`--no-bgjob`|Disable background jobs, default to false, which means clients by default carry out background jobs, including:<br/><ul><li>Clean up expired files in Trash (look for `cleanupDeletedFiles`, `cleanupTrash` in [`pkg/meta/base.go`](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/pkg/meta/base.go))</li><li>Delete slices that's not referenced (look for `cleanupSlices` in [`pkg/meta/base.go`](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/pkg/meta/base.go))</li><li>Clean up stale client sessions (look for `CleanStaleSessions` in [`pkg/meta/base.go`](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/pkg/meta/base.go))</li></ul>Note that compaction isn't affected by this option, it happens automatically with file reads and writes, client will check if compaction is in need, and run in background (take Redis for example, look for `compactChunk` in [`pkg/meta/base.go`](https://github.com/juicedata/juicefs/blob/main/pkg/meta/redis.go)).|
|`--atime-mode=noatime` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |Control atime (last time the file was accessed) behavior, support the following modes:<br/><ul><li>`noatime` (default): set when the file is created or when `SetAttr` is explicitly called. Accessing and modifying the file will not affect atime, tracking atime comes at a performance cost, so this is the default behavior</li><li>`relatime`: update inode access times relative to mtime (last time when the file data was modified) or ctime (last time when file metadata was changed). Only update atime if atime was earlier than the current mtime or ctime, or the file's atime is more than 1 day old</li><li>`strictatime`: always update atime on access</li></ul>|
|`--skip-dir-nlink=20` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |number of retries after which the update of directory nlink will be skipped (used for tkv only, 0 means never) (default: 20)|
|`--skip-dir-mtime=100ms` <VersionAdd>1.2</VersionAdd>|skip updating attribute of a directory if the mtime difference is smaller than this value (default: 100ms)|

#### Metadata cache related options {#mount-metadata-cache-options}

For metadata cache description and usage, refer to [Kernel metadata cache](../guide/cache.md#kernel-metadata-cache) and [Client memory metadata cache](../guide/cache.md#client-memory-metadata-cache).

|Items|Description|
|-|-|
|`--attr-cache=1`|attributes cache timeout in seconds (default: 1), read [Kernel metadata cache](../guide/cache.md#kernel-metadata-cache)|
|`--entry-cache=1`|file entry cache timeout in seconds (default: 1), read [Kernel metadata cache](../guide/cache.md#kernel-metadata-cache)|
|`--dir-entry-cache=1`|dir entry cache timeout in seconds (default: 1), read [Kernel metadata cache](../guide/cache.md#kernel-metadata-cache)|
|`--open-cache=0`|open file cache timeout in seconds (0 means disable this feature) (default: 0)|
|`--open-cache-limit value` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |max number of open files to cache (soft limit, 0 means unlimited) (default: 10000)|

#### Data storage related options {#mount-data-storage-options}

|Items|Description|
|-|-|
|`--storage=file`|Object storage type (e.g. `s3`, `gs`, `oss`, `cos`) (default: `"file"`, refer to [documentation](../reference/how_to_set_up_object_storage.md#supported-object-storage) for all supported object storage types).|
|`--bucket=value`|customized endpoint to access object storage|
|`--storage-class value` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |the storage class for data written by current client|
|`--get-timeout=60`|the max number of seconds to download an object (default: 60)|
|`--put-timeout=60`|the max number of seconds to upload an object (default: 60)|
|`--io-retries=10`|The number of retries when the network is abnormal and the number of retries for metadata requests are also controlled by this option. If the number of retries is exceeded, an `EIO Input/output error` error will be returned. (default: 10)|
|`--max-uploads=20`|Upload concurrency, defaults to 20. This is already a reasonably high value for 4M writes, with such write pattern, increasing upload concurrency usually demands higher `--buffer-size`, learn more at [Read/Write Buffer](../guide/cache.md#buffer-size). But for random writes around 100K, 20 might not be enough and can cause congestion at high load, consider using a larger upload concurrency, or try to consolidate small writes in the application end. |
|`--max-stage-write=0` <VersionAdd>1.2</VersionAdd>|The maximum number of concurrent writes of data blocks to the cache disk asynchronously. If the maximum number of concurrent writes is reached, the object storage will be uploaded directly (this option is only valid when ["Client write data cache"](../guide/cache.md#client-write-cache) is enabled) (default value: 0, that is, no concurrency limit)|
|`--max-deletes=10`|number of threads to delete objects (default: 10)|
|`--upload-limit=0`|bandwidth limit for upload in Mbps (default: 0)|
|`--download-limit=0`|bandwidth limit for download in Mbps (default: 0)|

#### Data cache related options {#mount-data-cache-options}

|Items|Description|
|-|-|
|`--buffer-size=300`|total read/write buffering in MiB (default: 300), see [Read/Write buffer](../guide/cache.md#buffer-size)|
|`--prefetch=1`|prefetch N blocks in parallel (default: 1), see [Client read data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-read-cache)|
|`--writeback`|upload objects in background (default: false), see [Client write data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-write-cache)|
|`--upload-delay=0`|When `--writeback` is enabled, you can use this option to add a delay to object storage upload, default to 0, meaning that upload will begin immediately after write. Different units are supported, including `s` (second), `m` (minute), `h` (hour). If files are deleted during this delay, upload will be skipped entirely, when using JuiceFS for temporary storage, use this option to reduce resource usage. Refer to [Client write data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-write-cache).|
|`--upload-hours` <VersionAdd>1.2</VersionAdd>|When `--writeback` is enabled, data blocks are only uploaded during the specified time of day. The format of the parameter is `<start hour>,<end hour>` (including "start hour", but not including "end hour", "start hour" must be less than or greater than "end hour"), where `<hour>` can range from 0 to 23. For example, `0,6` means that data blocks are only uploaded between 0:00 and 5:59 every day, and `23,3` means that data blocks are only uploaded between 23:00 every day and 2:59 the next day.|
|`--cache-dir=value`|directory paths of local cache, use `:` (Linux, macOS) or `;` (Windows) to separate multiple paths (default: `$HOME/.juicefs/cache` or `/var/jfsCache`), see [Client read data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-read-cache)|
|`--cache-mode value` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |file permissions for cached blocks (default: "0600")|
|`--cache-size=102400`|size of cached object for read in MiB (default: 102400), see [Client read data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-read-cache)|
|`--free-space-ratio=0.1`|min free space ratio (default: 0.1), if [Client write data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-write-cache) is enabled, this option also controls write cache size, see [Client read data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-read-cache)|
|`--cache-partial-only`|cache random/small read only (default: false), see [Client read data cache](../guide/cache.md#client-read-cache)|
|`--verify-cache-checksum=full` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |Checksum level for cache data. After enabled, checksum will be calculated on divided parts of the cache blocks and stored on disks, which are used for verification during reads. The following strategies are supported:<br/><ul><li>`none`: Disable checksum verification, if local cache data is tampered, bad data will be read;</li><li>`full` (default): Perform verification when reading the full block, use this for sequential read scenarios;</li><li>`shrink`: Perform verification on parts that's fully included within the read range, use this for random read scenarios;</li><li>`extend`: Perform verification on parts that fully include the read range, this causes read amplifications and is only used for random read scenarios demanding absolute data integrity.</li></ul>|
|`--cache-eviction=2-random` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |cache eviction policy (`none` or `2-random`) (default: "2-random")|
|`--cache-scan-interval=1h` <VersionAdd>1.1</VersionAdd> |interval (in seconds) to scan cache-dir to rebuild in-memory index (default: "1h")|
|`--cache-expire=0` <VersionAdd>1.2</VersionAdd>|Cache blocks that have not been accessed for more than the set time, in seconds, will be automatically cleared (even if the value of `--cache-eviction` is `none`, these cache blocks will be deleted). A value of 0 means never expires (default: 0)|

#### Metrics related options {#mount-metrics-options}

|-|-|
|`--metrics=127.0.0.1:9567`|address to export metrics (default: `127.0.0.1:9567`)|
|`--custom-labels`|custom labels for metrics, format: `key1:value1;key2:value2` (default: "")|
|`--consul=127.0.0.1:8500`|Consul address to register (default: `127.0.0.1:8500`)|
|`--no-usage-report`|do not send usage report (default: false)|
