# How to destroy a file system

JuiceFS client provides the `destroy` command to completely destroy a file system, which will result in the following.

- Delete all metadata entries of this file system
- Deletes all data blocks of the file system

The command to destroy a file system is as follows.

```shell
juicefs destroy <METADATA URL> <UUID>
```

- `<METADATA URL>`: The URL address of the metadata engine
- `<UUID>`: The UUID of the file system

## Find the UUID of the file system

The `status` command on the JuiceFS client can view detailed information about a file system by simply specifying the file system's metadata engine URL, e.g.

```shell {8}
$ juicefs status redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1

2022/01/26 21:41:37.577645 juicefs[31181] <INFO>: Meta address: redis://127.0.0.1:6379/1
2022/01/26 21:41:37.578238 juicefs[31181] <INFO>: Ping redis: 55.041µs

## Destroy a file system

:::danger
The destroy operation will cause all the data in the database records and object storage associated with the file system to be deleted, please make sure to backup the important data first before operation!

If you receive an error like the one above, which indicates that the file system has not been properly unmounted, please check and confirm that all mount points are unmounted before proceeding.
