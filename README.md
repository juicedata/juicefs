**JuiceFS** is a high-performance [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX) file system released under Apache License 2.0, particularly designed for the cloud-native environment. The data, stored via JuiceFS, will be persisted in object storage (e.g. Amazon S3), and the corresponding metadata can be persisted in various database engines such as Redis, MySQL, and SQLite based on the scenarios and requirements.

With JuiceFS, massive cloud storage can be directly connected to big data, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and various application platforms in production environments. Without modifying code, the massive cloud storage can be used as efficiently as local storage.

## Architecture

JuiceFS consists of three parts:

1. **JuiceFS Client**: Coordinate the implementation of object storage and metadata storage engines as well as file system interfaces such as POSIX, Hadoop, Kubernetes, and S3 gateway.
2. **Data Storage**: Support data storage in local disk and object storage.
3. **Metadata Engine**: Support storage of metadata that corresponds to the stored data on multiple engines such as Redis, MySQL, and SQLite.

![JuiceFS Architecture](docs/en/images/juicefs-arch-new.png)

The metadata of file system will be stored via JuiceFS through Redis, which is a fast, open-source, in-memory key-value data storage, particularly suitable for storing metadata; meanwhile, all the data will be stored in object storage through JuiceFS client. [Learn more](docs/en/introduction/architecture.md)

![JuiceFS Storage Format](docs/en/images/juicefs-storage-format-new.png)

Each file stored in JuiceFS will be split into **"Chunk"** s at a fixed size with the default upper limit of 64 MiB. Each Chunk is composed of one or more **"Slice"**(s). The length of the slice varies depending on how the file is written. Each slice will be further split into size-fixed **"Block"** (s), which is 4 MiB by default. In the end, these blocks will be stored in object storage; at the same time, JuiceFS will store the file and its Chunks, Slices, Blocks and other metadata information in metadata engines. [Learn more](docs/en/reference/how_juicefs_store_files.md)

![How JuiceFS stores your files](docs/en/images/how-juicefs-stores-files-new.png)

When using JuiceFS, files will eventually be split into Chunks, Slices and Blocks and stored in object storage. Therefore, you may find that the source files stored in JuiceFS cannot be found in the file browser of the object storage platform. Instead, there are only a chunks directory and a bunch of digitally numbered directories and files in the bucket. But don't panic! This is just the secret of the high-performance operation of JuiceFS!

## Getting Started

To create a JuiceFS, you need the following 3 preparations:

1. Redis database for metadata storage
2. Object storage is used to store data blocks
3. JuiceFS Client

Please refer to [Quick Start Guide](https://juicefs.com/docs/community/quick_start_guide) in the community doc (or doc in [this repo](docs/en/getting-started/for_local.md))
 to start using JuiceFS immediately!

### Command Reference

There is a [command reference](docs/en/reference/command_reference.md) to see all options of the subcommand.

### Kubernetes

[Using JuiceFS on Kubernetes](docs/en/deployment/how_to_use_on_kubernetes.md) is so easy, have a try.

### Hadoop Java SDK

If you wanna use JuiceFS in Hadoop, check [Hadoop Java SDK](docs/en/deployment/hadoop_java_sdk.md).

## POSIX Compatibility

JuiceFS passed all of the 8813 tests in latest [pjdfstest](https://github.com/pjd/pjdfstest).

```
All tests successful.

Test Summary Report
-------------------
/root/soft/pjdfstest/tests/chown/00.t          (Wstat: 0 Tests: 1323 Failed: 0)
  TODO passed:   693, 697, 708-709, 714-715, 729, 733
Files=235, Tests=8813, 233 wallclock secs ( 2.77 usr  0.38 sys +  2.57 cusr  3.93 csys =  9.65 CPU)
Result: PASS
```

Besides the things covered by pjdfstest, JuiceFS provides:

- Close-to-open consistency. Once a file is closed, the following open and read are guaranteed see the data written before close. Within same mount point, read can see all data written before it immediately.
- Rename and all other metadata operations are atomic guaranteed by Redis transaction.
- Open files remain accessible after unlink from same mount point.
- Mmap is supported (tested with FSx).
- Fallocate with punch hole support.
- Extended attributes (xattr).
- BSD locks (flock).
- POSIX record locks (fcntl).

## Performance Benchmark

### Basic benchmark

JuiceFS provides a subcommand to run a few basic benchmarks to understand how it works in your environment:

![JuiceFS Bench](docs/en/images/juicefs-bench.png)

### Throughput

Performed a sequential read/write benchmark on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [fio](https://github.com/axboe/fio), here is the result:

![Sequential Read Write Benchmark](docs/en/images/sequential-read-write-benchmark.svg)

It shows JuiceFS can provide 10X more throughput than the other two, read [more details](docs/en/benchmark/fio.md).

### Metadata IOPS

Performed a simple mdtest benchmark on JuiceFS, [EFS](https://aws.amazon.com/efs) and [S3FS](https://github.com/s3fs-fuse/s3fs-fuse) by [mdtest](https://github.com/hpc/ior), here is the result:

![Metadata Benchmark](docs/en/images/metadata-benchmark.svg)

It shows JuiceFS can provide significantly more metadata IOPS than the other two, read [more details](docs/en/benchmark/mdtest.md).

### Analyze performance

There is a virtual file called `.accesslog` in the root of JuiceFS to show all the operations and the time they takes, for example:

```bash
$ cat /jfs/.accesslog
2021.01.15 08:26:11.003330 [uid:0,gid:0,pid:4403] write (17669,8666,4993160): OK <0.000010>
2021.01.15 08:26:11.003473 [uid:0,gid:0,pid:4403] write (17675,198,997439): OK <0.000014>
2021.01.15 08:26:11.003616 [uid:0,gid:0,pid:4403] write (17666,390,951582): OK <0.000006>
```

The last number on each line is the time (in seconds) current operation takes. You can use this directly to debug and analyze performance issues, or try `./juicefs profile /jfs` to monitor real time statistics. Please run `./juicefs profile -h` or refer to [here](docs/en/benchmark/operations_profiling.md) to learn more about this subcommand.

## FAQ

### Why doesn't JuiceFS support XXX object storage?

JuiceFS already supported many object storage, please check [the list](docs/en/reference/how_to_setup_object_storage.md#supported-object-storage) first. If this object storage is compatible with S3, you could treat it as S3. Otherwise, try reporting issue.

### Can I use Redis cluster?

The simple answer is no. JuiceFS uses [transaction](https://redis.io/topics/transactions) to guarantee the atomicity of metadata operations, which is not well supported in cluster mode. Sentinal or other HA solution for Redis are needed.

See ["Redis Best Practices"](docs/en/administration/metadata/redis_best_practices.md) for more information.

### What's the difference between JuiceFS and XXX?

See ["Comparison with Others"](docs/en/comparison) for more information.
